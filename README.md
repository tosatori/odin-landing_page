This Exercise is part of the Odin Projects learning path. It's the final project in the CSS/Flexbox foundations section. The goal is to build a webpage from scratch and use all the concepts that have been part of the foundations course.

By doing this exercise I learned about planning out a project ahead of writing code, how to use flexboxes and problems that can occur.
